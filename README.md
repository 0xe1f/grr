grr >:(
=======

**grr** is an attempt at replacing the gaping hole that the impending departure of [Google Reader] [1] will leave in my daily routine. Its (initially temporary) name is an abbreviation for _Google Reader Replacement_, but seeing as how it also doubles as a decent onomatopoeic representation of my feelings towards the discontinuation of one of Google's most useful products, it's now the app's de-facto name.

_grr_ consists of two components - the web server application, which interacts with the user, and the shell application, which routinely updates feeds in the background.

You can see a video of it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gIGjweNu7Q

Features
--------

Primary focus of _grr_ was to replicate the core functionality of [Google Reader] [1] - specifically, features like starring, reading/unreading, navigation, and subscription categories. To that extent, _grr_ supports:

* Subscription categories
* Starring
* Marking as read/unread (single articles as well as entire views)
* Filtering by status (All/Unread/Starred)
* Paging
* Tagging
* Simple navigation using Previous/Next buttons
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Ability to subscribe to individual feeds

Additional features include:

* Infinite nesting for subscription categories
* Article 'liking', along with 'like' counts (this feature was available on Google Reader at some point)
* Client-side background synchronization
* Ability to mass-import feeds from OPML-formatted documents (such as those generated by [Google Takeout] [7])
* Support for any number of user accounts
* Built-in [OpenID] [6] support

Requirements
------------

On the server side, _grr_ requires:

* [Apache] [8] server with [PHP] [2] support
* [MySQL] [3] server
* [cron] [4], or any other scheduling service to routinely update feed information

On the client side, _grr_ relies heavily on [JavaScript] [5] and probably needs a decent modern browser.

Installation
------------

To install:

1. Copy the contents of the [server](server) directory to a www-accessible directory
2. Copy the contents of the [shell](shell) directory to a private area not accessible via www
3. Import the MySQL schema in [schema_full.mysql](etc/schema_full.mysql) to a MySQL database
4. Rename web application's [default.config.php](server/include/default.config.php) to 'config.php' and set all the necessary configuration information
5. Rename shell application's [default.config.php](shell/default.config.php) to 'config.php' and set the timezone and database configuration
6. Log in to the web application and create a new administrative account
7. Schedule [crawl.sh](shell/crawl.sh) to run routinely

Note that the web application, the database and shell application components do not have to reside on the same system.

Creating User Accounts
----------------------

Depending on configuration, _grr_ can allow anyone to create a new account (see the "CREATE_UNKNOWN_ACCOUNTS" setting in the configuration, disabled by default), or require a "welcome token" link to create a new account. Welcome token links can be generated in the Administrator section of the application and are valid for 2 weeks.

Limitations
-----------

_grr_ is currently in a late-alpha/early-beta stage, and as a result:

* The design of the web application is atrocious, because _dammit Kirk, I'm a programmer, not a designer!_
* Administrative features were mostly an afterthought and could certainly do with a redesign/overhaul
