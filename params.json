{"name":"grr","tagline":"Lightweight Replacement for Google Reader","body":"grr >:(\r\n=======\r\n\r\n**grr** is a lightweight [Google Reader] [1] replacement, supporting many primary features of Reader with support for multiple users.\r\n\r\n_grr_ consists of a web server application, which interacts with the user, and a shell application, which is routinely executed to update feeds in the background.\r\n\r\n_grr_ is currently in a late alpha/early beta stage.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Feed hierarchy (nesting feeds inside folders)\r\n* Starring\r\n* Marking as read/unread (single articles as well as entire views)\r\n* Filtering by status (All/Unread/Starred)\r\n* Paging\r\n* Support for multiple users\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nOn the server side, _grr_ requires:\r\n\r\n* Web server with [PHP] [2] support\r\n* [MySQL] [3] server\r\n* [cron] [4], or any other scheduling service to routinely update feed information\r\n\r\nOn the client side, _grr_ relies heavily on [JavaScript] [5] and probably a decent modern browser. Authentication requires an OpenID account (any OpenID account).\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.google.com/reader/  \"Google Reader\"\r\n  [2]: http://us.php.net/ \"PHP\"  \r\n  [3]: http://www.mysql.com/ \"MySQL\"\r\n  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron \"cron\"\r\n  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript \"JavaScript\"\r\n","google":"UA-40474748-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
